# reactnd-mobile-flashcards
Mobile flashcards allows users to create their own deck of flashcards. 
Once a deck has been created, users can add any number of cards in a deck 
and can start taking the quiz. In every quiz, the user may mark the card as 
correct or incorrect based on the user's guessed answer. There is also a 
show answer button for the user to see the correct answer. Once the quiz is done, 
a percentage score will be shown. Further more, at the end of every quiz, there 
will be an option to restart the quiz and go back to the list of decks.
